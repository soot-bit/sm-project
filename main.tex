% The fonts, linespacing, numbering, page styles, order
% of  Title/Abstract/TOC/Body/{Appendices}/Acknowledgements/References 
% are prescribed as the AIMS house style.

% Do not change them or add to it without getting approval first.
% Essays are not accepted if they do not follow house style.
% This is in preparation for your Masters where the university
% will be much more strict on the house style.

%--------------------Preamble:
\input{FrontMatter/preamble}




%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
% Your own command shortcuts can go here
% keep them clearly separate from other sections of the preamble
% It is good style to have only a few of these so that
% we can read one another's code. If you have to many, 
% then your code does not compile in someone else's template easily,
% and it makes it harder to read. These definitions are only
% meant for very often-used commands to save typing; Examples:
%
%\newcommand {\be}{\begin{equation}}
%\newcommand {\ee}{\end{equation}}
%\newcommand {\C}{\mathbb{C}} % Complex
%\newcommand {\Z}{\mathbb{Z}} % Integers
%\newcommand {\R}{\mathbb{R}} % Real
%\DeclareMathOperator{\sech}{sech} % declaring new math operators like \sin.
%

% Title & Author
\input{FrontMatter/title.tex}





%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
%\selectlanguage{english}
\pagestyle{empty}
\maketitle





% All other files are included via \input. 
% To compile in texmaker while viewing any of those
% without having to switch back, use
%   Options > Define Current Document as 'Master Document'
% To not have to close a PDF, remove viewpdf from quickbuild 
% and open the PDF (once) manually: it will auto-refresh or with control-r
% 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The abstract is the first thing we want to see. No acknowledgements or 
% dedications here. Fetch the abstract from a separate file.
% Please write it in English and in your mother tongue.
% An abstract should be less than half a page, so that both abstracts 
% (that is both languages) fit onto one page.
% We number roman numerals until the main body
\pagenumbering{roman}
\input{FrontMatter/abstract}




% Don't go typing out the contents.
\tableofcontents
\newpage
% We switch to arabic numerals here where your page count starts
% Essays must be close to 30 pages long *starting here* and up to and including
% the conclcusion. It does not include the acknowledgements or references.
% 
% Figures may differ between topics, but they are not there
% to fill the pages -- they must add meaning.
% In general most figures should be 0.8 times the width of the page
% (perhaps wider in total when two or three columns of figures)
% See the example in chapter one for defining that. Be *consistent*
% in your presentation of information.
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\pagestyle{myheadings}




%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Each chapter goes in a separate file
% Chapter titles are just examples
% Always have a question
% Note the Case Pattern used at AIMS
\input{Sections/chapter1} % Introduction is usually a chapter itself.
\input{Sections/chapter2} % Chapters might go from 2. problem statement, 
                 % through 3. model, to 4. analysis & results
\input{Sections/chapter3} % You do not need to have exactly 4 chapters.
                 % It is probably a good minimum, with 5 chapters 
                 % average, and 7 chapters might be a maximum.
\input{Sections/chapter4} % Conclusion is usually a chapter itself. 
%\input{chapter5} % You may have more chapters. (Use e.g. git add FILE)
% This is where we stop counting pages.
% Acknowledgements and References are not counted.





%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% See the acknowledgement.tex file and follow the instructions there.
\input{Sections/acknowledgement}




%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Note the errata page is not for now, it is for use during the examination.
% Not that you're going to have any errata.




%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% THE BIBLIOGRAPHY 
% Bibliography styles define how the bibliography is 
% listed and formatted. This is part of the AIMS house
% style and is only changed under exceptional circumstances
\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
\nocite{*}
\bibliographystyle{myabbrvnat}
